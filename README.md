# Class Timetable Generator

This Jupyter notebook uses Python and the Pandas library to generate a class timetable from a CSV file. Note that this project is limited to the format of the CSV file. However, if you learn the data cleaning procedures used in this notebook, you can apply them to your own CSV schedule files and generate your own timetables.

## Getting Started

To use this notebook, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download it here: https://jupyter.org/install

Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open the `multi-section-timetable.ipynb` file and run the code cells.

## How to Use

When you run the notebook, it will prompt you to input your section. If you belong to one section only, you can type your section (e.g. A, B, C, D, 1) and the notebook will generate a timetable for your section. If you belong to multiple sections or want to create a custom timetable, type '!N' and follow the prompts to select your subjects and sections.

Note that the generated timetable is based on the CSV file's format, so make sure your CSV file matches the format before running the notebook.
